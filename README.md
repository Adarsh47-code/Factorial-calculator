This factorial calculator was built using JavaScript and will run on node.

## What is does.
1. Takes a number input from the user via terminal
2.  Calculates the factorial using array logic and using "Reduce()" method.
3.  Handles invalid inputs and negative numbers.

Clone this Repo and paste it on your VS code and turn on terminal as node. Or maybe run in a browser console if you are comfortable with it.

## Tech Stack- Node.js
- JavaScript
- readline module for terminal input

 ## Why I Built This
 I wanted to prove that ideas matter more than past scores. I had the vision, wrote the steps on paper, and learned how to turn them into code. This project is my first badge in the journey to becoming a student CEO and squad mentor.
